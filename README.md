### Day 2 ‚Äì Box Model and Elements

12. `height`
13. `width`
14. `padding` ‚Äì Inner spacing
15. `margin` ‚Äì Outer spacing
16. `border` ‚Äì Outline around elements
17. `font-style` (revisited)
18. `box-shadow` ‚Äì Shadow effects
19. `<span>` ‚Äì Inline text container
20. `*` ‚Äì Universal selector to target all elements  
21. Block-Level vs Inline Elements

    Block elements form the main structure of a page. They always start on a new line and take up the full width available by default.

    **Characteristics:**
    - Start on a new line
    - Take full width of the parent container
    - Width and height can be set
    - Respect all margins and padding

    **Examples:**

    ```html
    <div>, <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>
    ```

    Inline elements flow along with text and only take up as much width as necessary.

    **Characteristics:**
    - Do not start on a new line
    - Only as wide as their content
    - Cannot set width or height directly
    - Only respect horizontal spacing

    **Examples:**

    ```html
    <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>
    ```

22. `display:inline` for making the block element to inline element.
No vertical styling like height, top etc types works on inlines then.

23. `display:block`for making the inline to behave as block element. (vice-versa of display:inline)

24. `display:inline` for combining the best features of the inline and block on any element

25. `box-sizing` controls how the browser calculates the total width and height of an element.

26. `box-sizing:content-box` Default.Padding and border are added outside, increasing total size.

27. `box-sizing:border-box`(recommended and mostly used) Width/height apply to content + padding + border all together. Total size stays as set.


### Day 4 ‚Äì Positioning, Stacking & Viewport Concepts


28. `CSS Priority and Specificity` ‚Äì Understanding the Myth

## CSS Priority: Inline > Internal > External (Half Myth!)


    This is only **half true**. The **actual priority or affection of CSS rules** does **not** solely depend on where the CSS is written (inline, internal, external), but rather on **which rule comes later** (in the cascade), **and the specificity** of the selector used.

    Think of CSS as checking rooms in a line:

    - You have **10 rooms** to check.
    - You must go **sequentially from Room 1 to Room 10**.
    - **You cannot go back** or **break the sequence**.
    - After visiting all rooms, **you choose the room with the most money to stay in**.

    In this analogy:

    - The **room number** represents the **order of CSS in the document**.
    - The **money in the room** represents the **selector specificity** or the **way CSS is applied**.

    ### Selector Specificity (Money in the Room)

    | Selector Type | Specificity (Money) | Notes                            |
    |---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
    | Inline CSS    | ‚Çπ1000               | Highest specificity              |
    | ID Selector   | ‚Çπ700                | High specificity (`#id`)        |
    | Class Selector| ‚Çπ500                | Medium specificity (`.class`)   |
    | Tag Selector  | ‚Çπ200                | Lowest specificity (`div`, `p`) |


    Even if a `tag selector` comes later in the cascade, an earlier `ID selector` or `inline style` might **win** due to higher specificity.

    So, **order (cascade) is important**, but **selector specificity (money) decides who actually wins**.
        ----
 29. `!important` Flag ‚Äì Top Priority Override

    If a CSS rule includes the `!important` flag, it **overrides all other rules**, regardless of specificity or order.

    ```css
    p {
    color: red !important;
    }    

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Use !important sparingly. It breaks the natural cascade and can make debugging CSS difficult.
        ----
 30. CSS Position Property ‚Äì Controlling Element Flow

    The `position` property determines how an element is placed in the document flow. Main values:

    - `static` (default): In normal flow, cannot use `top`, `left`, etc.
    - `relative`: In flow, but can be nudged visually using `top`, `left`, etc.
    - `absolute`: Removed from flow, positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor.
    - `fixed`: Removed from flow, positioned relative to the viewport (screen).
    - `sticky`: Behaves like `relative` until a scroll threshold, then acts like `fixed`.

    üìå Absolute, fixed, and sticky are out of the normal flow. Relative and static are in the flow.

---

31. CSS Z-Index ‚Äì Layering Elements

    The `z-index` property controls the stacking order of positioned elements.

    - Higher `z-index` = appears on top
    - Only works on elements with `position` set to `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`
    
    ```css
    .box1 {
      position: relative;
      z-index: 10;
    }
    .box2 {
      position: relative;
      z-index: 5;
    }
    ```

    üìå Default stacking: later elements appear on top unless z-index says otherwise.

---

32. Viewport ‚Äì What You See

    The viewport is the **visible area** of the web page ‚Äî what fits inside the browser window.

    - Units like `vw` (viewport width) and `vh` (viewport height) relate to this area
    - Elements with `position: fixed` are stuck to the viewport and don't scroll with the page

    üìå Viewport ‚â† entire page. It‚Äôs just the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù through which we view the page.

---

33. Scroll Behavior & Flow Impact

    Only elements in the **normal document flow** contribute to page height and scrolling.

    - `relative` and `static` elements add height ‚Üí scrollable
    - `absolute` and `fixed` elements do **not** ‚Üí no scroll added unless inside a scrollable container

    üìå If your page doesn‚Äôt scroll, check if you‚Äôre using too many fixed/absolute elements.

---

34. Practical Use of Positioning in Real Projects

    ‚úÖ Common use cases:
    - `relative`: as a positioning context or slight adjustment
    - `absolute`: tooltips, dropdowns, badges, floating elements
    - `fixed`: sticky navbars, back-to-top buttons, modals
    - `sticky`: headers that stick on scroll (e.g., table headers)

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Use positioning intentionally. Avoid layout bugs by understanding flow and stacking.

---

35. Projects Built Using Positioning Concepts

    - üá´üá∑ Contriex Flag: Used `absolute` and `relative` to position colored blocks correctly
    - üéØ Sticky Navbar UI: Demonstrated `sticky` and `fixed` in scrollable layout
    - üí¨ Tooltip Component: Built using `position: absolute` inside a `relative` parent
    - ü™ü Modal Popup: Centered using `fixed` + `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`

    üìå These helped apply `z-index`, flow rules, and viewport logic practically.

### Day 4 ‚Äì Positioning, Stacking & Viewport Concepts

36. **`display: flex`**

    - Applied on the **parent container**, flexbox affects how **child elements** are laid out.
    - Enables flexible and responsive layouts.

37. **Main Axis and Cross Axis**

    - Flexbox layouts have two axes:
    - **Main axis**: Direction defined by `flex-direction` (`row` or `column`).
    - **Cross axis**: Perpendicular to the main axis.
  
38. **`justify-content`**

    - Aligns children **along the main axis**.
    - Common values:
    - `flex-start` (default)
    - `center`
    - `flex-end`
    - `space-between`
    - `space-around`
    - `space-evenly`

39. **`align-items`**

    - Aligns children **along the cross axis**.
    - Common values:
    - `stretch` (default)
    - `center`
    - `flex-start`
    - `flex-end`
    - `baseline`

40. **Flex Properties on Children**

    - `flex-grow`: Defines how much a flex item will grow relative to others.
    - `flex-shrink`: Defines how much a flex item will shrink relative to others.
    - `flex-basis`: Sets the initial main size of a flex item before growing or shrinking.
    - `align-self`: Overrides `align-items` for individual items.

41. **Flex Wrap & Gap**

    - `flex-wrap: wrap;` allows flex items to wrap onto multiple lines.
    - `gap` creates spacing between flex items easily without margins.

42. **Practical Notes**

    - Flexbox simplifies layout tasks like centering, spacing, and ordering elements.
    - It replaces many older layout hacks involving floats and positioning.
    - Experiment with `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and flex child properties to control layout precisely.

    #### Example Summary from Today's Practice:

    ```css
    #container {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        gap: 20px;
        height: 700px;
        width: 100%;
    }

        #f { background-color: antiquewhite; }
        #s { background-color: aqua; flex-shrink: 2; }
        #t { background-color: blueviolet; align-self: flex-end; }
        #fo { background-color: brown; flex-basis: 120px; }
        #fi { background-color: burlywood; }
        
43. **Responsive Behavior with Flexbox**

- Flex items automatically adjust their size and position to fit different screen sizes.
- Using `flex-wrap: wrap` lets items flow into multiple rows or columns on smaller screens.
- Combining `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` allows flexible and adaptive layouts without media queries in many cases.
